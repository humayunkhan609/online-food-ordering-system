# Online Food Ordering System

A project to simulate the SDLC for an online food ordering platform, completed over a 2-week timeline (April 26 â€“ May 10, 2025), with an additional phase for closure.

## Project Overview
This project simulates the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for an Online Food Ordering System, covering requirements engineering, project management, design, and demo development. The system aims to allow customers to browse menus, place orders, and enable restaurants to receive notifications.

## Folder Structure
- **code/**: Placeholder for future implementation code.
- **diagrams/**: UML diagrams and architecture designs (e.g., Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram, ERD).
- **docs/**: Project documentation (e.g., SRS).

## Key Artifacts
- **SRS**: See `docs/SRS.md` for the Software Requirements Specification.
- **Diagrams**: Architecture, Class, Sequence, and ERD in `diagrams/`.
- **JIRA Setup**: User stories and sprint planning (PHASE 2).

## Demo Access
This repository serves as the demo, showcasing the project structure and design artifacts. Stakeholders can explore the files directly.

## Next Steps
- Actual implementation of the system using the designs provided.
- Deployment to a live environment for real-world testing.
